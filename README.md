# AI_ChatBot

## Introduction

This is a simple AI chatbot that uses GPT 3 turbo engine to generate responses.
This project has a front-end folder and a back-end folder. The front-end folder contains the code for the user interface and the back-end folder contains the code for the server and the GPT 3 engine.

## Frontend

I will use NextJS with tailwindcss to build the frontend of the chatbot.

## Backend

I will use Python >= 3.8, FastAPI, Pydantic Beanie and GPT 3 engine to build the backend of the chatbot.
